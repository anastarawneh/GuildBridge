## Installation
1. Install [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html). (This step depends on the launcher you use, if [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+minecraft+forge) can't help you, feel free to shoot me a Discord DM (Anas#4896) and I'd be happy to help you out.)
2. Download the mod from the [releases](https://github.com/anastarawneh/GuildBridge/releases) page and place it in your `.minecraft/mods` folder. (If you can't find it, you can create it manually.)
3. Launch the game and close it once it fully launches, to generate the configuration file.
4. Edit `guildbridge.cfg` in your `.minecraft/config` directory, and set the `bridgeUsername` value to the username of the account the Discord bridge runs on.
5. Launch the game, any Discord messages sent in Guild chat by the specified account should now be formatted.

## Installation
1. Install [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html). (This step depends on the launcher you use, if [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+minecraft+forge) can't help you, feel free to shoot me a Discord DM (Anas#4896) and I'd be happy to help you out.)
2. Download the mod from the [releases](https://github.com/anastarawneh/GuildBridge/releases) page and place it in your `.minecraft/mods` folder. (If you can't find it, you can create it manually.)
3. Launch the game.
4. Edit the mod config in `Mod Options` in the title screen or in your pause menu, and add the username(s) of the account(s) the Discord bridge runs on to the `Bridge Usernames` list, then set the guild message format as needed (`$username` for the username, `$message` for the message).
5. Any Discord messages sent in Guild chat by the specified account(s) should now be formatted.
